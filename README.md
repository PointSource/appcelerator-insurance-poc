# Appcelerator Insurance POC

This app explores our ability to use Appcelerator's [Titanium](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium) and [Alloy](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Framework) tools for some typical features that we often implement in a PointSource app.

This documentation should help web developers get some familiarity with the quirks and differences in Appcelerator as compared to html / css.
